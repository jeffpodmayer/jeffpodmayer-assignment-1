                Our science based approach creates music that sounds different-and affects your 
                brain differently-than any other music.

            <h3>Patented Technology</h3>
            <p>
                Brain.fm holds patents on kep processes for creating functional music, including technology to
                elicit <span>strong neural phase locking</span>-allowing populations of nuerons to engage in various 
                kinds of coordinated activity-and technology to remove distraction in sound.
               </br>
                This makes our music unique, purpose built to steer you into a desired mental state. In other
                words, we've found new ways to create music that helps you do what you need to do.

            <h3>Tested on Brain and Behavior</h3>
            <p>
                Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic institutions to run experiments.
                </br>
                We look at the effects of or technology on the brain, using fMRI and EEG, and also run 
                large-scale behavioral tests, measuring performance on simple games.
                </br>
                <span>Our experiments always include a control condition('placebo')</span> of the
                same underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied, so we can be sure our tech
                is what makes the difference.
